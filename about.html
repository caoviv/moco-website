    <h4>WHY MOCO?</h4>
    <h1>A GYM, WELLNESS STUDIO AND HEALTH CLINIC CREATED FOR OUR COMMUNITY</h1>
    <p>
        WITH OVER 20 YEARS IN THE FITNESS AND HEALTH INDUSTRIES, WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISE AND MOVEMENT, WE’VE SEEN IT ALL.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’ve watched fitness trends come and go. We’ve seen monumental developments in health sciences. We’ve set and achieved our own fitness goals and helped countless clients smash theirs too.<br>
        We know that each person who walks through our doors is different. Some have clear goals and targets, others need a little bit of guidance. Some are recovering from major surgery, others have never been to hospital. Some like to stay in their comfort zone, others like to be pushed to the limit. Some have plenty of time to dedicate to exercise, others are squeezing in an hour here or there in between family, work and social commitments.<br>
        Tired of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, we set out to create a truly holistic movement and wellness space to help each and every member of our community maximise their results and achieve their goals, regardless of their level of fitness, their motivation and their schedules.<br>
